Description: Fast generators and iterators of permutations, combinations and partitions. The iterators allow users to generate arrangements in a memory efficient manner and the generated arrangements are in lexicographical (dictionary) order. Permutations and combinations can be drawn with/without replacement and support multisets. It has been demonstrated that 'arrangements' outperforms most of the existing packages of similar kind.
